{"name":"Active Bean Fitness","tagline":"","body":"# Active Bean Fitness - Overview\r\n\r\n## What is the app?\r\nThis is a service used to record fitness activities, track progress, track equipment wear.  TODO\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nWe're building an app about something we are passionate about.  At the same time, we want to learn how to use many different modern web technologies.  The application may incorporate many duplicate functions, such as multiple databases or multiple UI frameworks, for the sake of learning.\r\n\r\nWe want to build an application with millions of records that span multiple servers.  We want to have so much data that efficient storage and retrieval become problems that we must solve.  The system should be massive, distributed, secure, performant, and fault-tolerant.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\nThe roadmap is a work in progress.\r\n\r\n### v1.0\r\n* AngularJS -- **done**\r\n* HTML 5 -- **done**\r\n* Java 8 -- **done**\r\n* Spring Boot -- **done**\r\n* Hibernate 4 -- **done**\r\n* MySQL -- **done**\r\n* Elasticsearch on 1 server, 1 million records. -- **done, but needs to be deployed**\r\n* Full-text search on all records -- **done**\r\n* User sign-up and authentication -- **done**\r\n* App security (user log-in, token authentication, CSRF & XSS protection, etc.) -- **done, except for CSRF token integration**\r\n\r\n### v2.0\r\n* Elasticsearch on 2 servers, 10 million records\r\n* User session information stored in external data store (Redis?)\r\n* Establish user roles for viewing private/public data.  For example, when a user logs in, they see their own fitness data and are unable to see other users' data.\r\n* iOS app\r\n\r\n### v3.0\r\n* Elasticsearch on 5 servers, 500 million records\r\n* In-memory database for data that is accessed most often\r\n* Android app\r\n\r\n### v4.0\r\n* MongoDB with 1 million records\r\n* Cassandra with 1 million records\r\n* Support two-factor authentication\r\n\r\n### v5.0\r\n* Support SSO through Google (and Facebook? and Twitter?)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
