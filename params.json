{"name":"Active Bean Fitness","tagline":"","body":"# Active Bean Fitness\r\n\r\nCurrent release - http://www.activebeancoders.com:8081\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\nActive Bean Fitness is a web-based application used to keep track of personal fitness activities.\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nWe're building an app about something we are passionate about.  At the same time, we want to learn how to use many different modern web technologies.  The application may incorporate many duplicate functions, such as multiple databases or multiple UI frameworks, for the sake of learning.\r\n\r\nWe want to build an application with millions of records that span multiple servers.  We want to have so much data that efficient storage and retrieval become problems we must solve.  The system should be a massive, distributed, fault-tolerant design.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\nThe roadmap is a work in progress.\r\n\r\n### v1.0\r\n* AngularJS\r\n* HTML 5\r\n* Java 8\r\n* Spring Boot\r\n* Hibernate 4\r\n* MySQL\r\n* Elasticsearch on 1 server, 1 million records.
