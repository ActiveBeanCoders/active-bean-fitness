TODO\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nWe're building an app about something we are passionate about.  At the same time, we want to learn how to use many different modern web technologies.  The application may incorporate many duplicate functions, such as multiple databases or multiple UI frameworks, for the sake of learning.\r\n\r\nWe want to build an application with millions of records that span multiple servers.  We want to have so much data that efficient storage and retrieval become problems that we must solve.  The system should be massive, distributed, secure, performant, and fault-tolerant.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\nThe roadmap is a work in progress.\r\n\r\n### v1.0\r\n* AngularJS\r\n* HTML 5\r\n* Java 8\r\n* Spring Boot\r\n* Hibernate 4\r\n* MySQL\r\n* Elasticsearch on 1 server, 1 million records.\r\n* Full-text search on all records\r\n* User sign-up and authentication\r\n* App security (user log-in, token authentication, CSRF & XSS protection, etc.)\r\n\r\n### v2.0\r\n* Elasticsearch on 2 servers, 10 million records\r\n* User session information stored in external data store (Redis?)\r\n* User ability to create private data\r\n* iOS app\r\n\r\n### v3.0\r\n* Elasticsearch on 5 servers, 500 million records\r\n* In-memory database for warm data\r\n* Android app\r\n\r\n### v4.0\r\n* MongoDB with 1 million records\r\n* Cassandra with 1 million records\r\n* Support two-factor authentication\r\n\r\n### v5.0\r\n* Dart for middle-tier\r\n* PolymerDart for UI\r\n* Support SSO through Google (and Facebook? and Twitter?)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
